# Missing Features
TODO Not being able to work with the top-level node sucks.
TODO Get things working in Google Hangouts.
	How do we send messages to all clients?
		Use the shared state or the messaging system.

TODO Add convenient movement operations.
	Move backwards and forwards.
	Swap with parent.
	Become the last child of the predecessor-sibling node.
	Make a node the next child of the parent node.
	Move a node left and right without changing the vertical position.

TODO Synchronization between clients.
	Timestamp messages.
	Instead of editing the state, keyboard/mouse inputs become messages.
	Receiving a message is what changes the state.
	Send a no-op message every-so-often.
	Add a message Queue.
		Messages don't get applied until we have a message from everybody.
			Will need to add logic to handle log/disconnections late on.

# Code Improvements
TODO Add more extensive QuickCheck testing.

# Potential Directions
TODO Support image/video nodes through special syntax.
TODO Add server-side support to save notes online.
	I'd like to use this for blogging and/or note-taking.
