# Missing Features
TODO Not being able to work with the top-level node sucks.
	Investigate how much trouble it would be to allow multiple top-level nodes.

TODO Get things working in Google Hangouts.
	How do we send messages to all clients?
		Use the shared state or the messaging system.

TODO Stop using ‘prompt()’.
	Use ‘<div><input/></div>’.
	Allow multi-line inputs and process then with Sanitize.

TODO Add convenient movement operations.
	Move the cursor visually up/down, ignoring nesting.
	Move a node left/right without changing the vertical position.
	Support sliding nodes around.
		This should be possible using any movement command.
	Support sliding sub-trees around.
		This should be possible using most movement commands.

TODO Synchronization between clients.
	Timestamp messages.
	Instead of editing the state, keyboard/mouse inputs become messages.
	Receiving a message is what changes the state.
	Send a no-op message every-so-often.
	Add a message Queue.
		Messages don't get applied until we have a message from everybody.
			Will need to add logic to handle log/disconnections late on.

# Code Improvements
TODO Add more extensive QuickCheck testing.

# Potential Directions
TODO Support image/video nodes through special syntax.
TODO Add server-side support to save notes online.
	I'd like to use this for blogging and/or note-taking.
