# Missing Features
TODO Get things working in Google Hangouts.
TODO Add an alternate, plaintext view.
TODO Add a copy-cut-paste with the ‘pyx’ keys.
TODO Add convenient movement operations.
	Move backwards and forwards.
	Swap with parent.
	Become the last child of the predecessor-sibling node.
	Make a node the next child of the parent node.
	Move a node left and right without changing the vertical position.

# Bugs
TODO Edit and Editor produce fatal errors when thing go bad.
	They should throw an exception. UI.js should catch it, print an error, and then
		drop whatever operation failed.

TODO ‘Editor.insAbove’ doesn't work on the top-level node.
	This is because it uses ADD internally which doesn't make sense on
	a top-level node.

# Code Improvements
TODO Add extensive QuickCheck testing.
TODO Cleanup OL.hs, Edit.hs, and Editor.hs. ∃some nasty code.
TODO How to implement timestamps in Javascript

# Potential Directions
TODO Support image/video nodes through special syntax.
TODO Add server-side support to save notes online.
	I'd like to use this for blogging and/or note-taking.
